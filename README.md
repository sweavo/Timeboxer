Only-just-good-enough kitchen timer app. This seeks to get as close as possible to the simplicity of a mechanical kitchen timer.

It has no pause, no options, no installer and three features: it counts down to zero, goes ping and stops. 

It has two bonus features: it can be moved and it can be quit.


Installation
------------

Put `Timeboxer.exe` somewhere on your machine.

You're done.


Operation
---------

Run `Timeboxer.exe`

To move the timer, drag it using the left mouse.

To set the time, use the right mousebutton to drag the sweep anywhere between 0 and 60m.  Release and the timer begins.

To quit, right-double-click the face.

To run multiple timers, run multiple instances of `Timeboxer.exe`


Now! Unleash the power of the command line!
-------------------------------------------

It takes 1 optional argument, which is the number of minutes you want the timer to run.

Make a shortcut with `Timeboxer.exe 25` in it!  Call it "Pomodoro" and leave it on your desktop!
