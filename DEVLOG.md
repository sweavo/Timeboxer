# DEVLOG

**Bottom-post in the devlog file; the Backlog stays at the bottom

## 2024-06-01 Devlog started

* `item 1` bring devlog and readme into the project `done`
* `item 2` write down how to release a version `done`

* * `item 3` make a regression test that would catch unshipped dependencies `done`

This is part of the release process, which is in the `package_release.ps1` script.

# Backlog

* `item 4` look for a file IO method that does not need added references
* `item 5` reimplement position save and load, see c4b3b87 for inspiration, but do it without a reference
