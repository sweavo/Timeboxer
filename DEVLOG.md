# Backlog

* `item 1` bring devlog and readme into the project
* `item 2` write down how to release a version
* `item 3` make a regression test that would catch unshipped dependencies
* `item 4` look for a file IO method that does not need added references
* `item 5` reimplement position save and load, see c4b3b87 for inspiration, but do it without a reference
